Why we use python?


simple and readable syntax (easy to learn)
Works for many fields: web, data science, AI, automation, games, etc.
Huge community and library support
Faster development time compared to low-level languages


Advantages:


Easy to learn and read 

Syntax is close to English
Fewer lines of code
print("Hello, World!")

2.  Versatile (Multi-Purpose)

Web development (Django, Flask)
Data science & AI (Pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow)
Automation & scripting
Machine learning
Game development
Cybersecurity

3.  Large Library Ecosystem

Thousands of built-in and third-party libraries

Saves time and effort

 
4. Cross-Platform

Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux without changes

5. Strong Community Support

Easy to find help, tutorials, and documentation

6. Rapid Development

Faster coding → faster testing faster deployment


Disadvantages:


1. Slower Execution Speed

Interpreted language

Slower than C, C++, or Java for performance-critical tasks

2. High Memory Usage

Uses more memory than low-level languages

3. Not Ideal for Mobile Apps

Rarely used for Android or iOS native apps

4. Runtime Errors

Errors appear while running the program (not before)

5. Weak in Low-Level Programming

Not suitable for OS kernels or device drivers


Summary:

Python is used because it is easy to learn, readable, and versatile. It helps developers build programs quickly for web development, data science, AI, and automation.

Advantages:

Simple and beginner-friendly

Supports many applications

Large libraries and strong community

Works on all platforms

Disadvantages:

Slower than some other languages

Uses more memory

Not ideal for mobile apps or low-level programming

Overall: Python is best for fast development and learning, but not for high-performance or system-level tasks.
